# Synthstone
*An assembler and verilog synthesizer for Minecraft*

# Assembler
Performs classic assembly of assembly files into machine code for our 0-tick base Minecraft computer, as well as turning the instruction set into the instruction decoder's read only memory.

# Synthesizer
Performs verilog synthesis and machine code to structure conversion. Pretty much everything that interfaces with Minecraft directly.
